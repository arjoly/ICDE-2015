% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\begin{abstract}
  Many machine learning tasks such as text annotation usually require
  training over very big datasets, e.g., millions of web documents,
  that can be represented in a sparse input space. State-of-the-art
  tree-based ensemble algorithms cannot scale to such datasets, since
  they include operations whose running time is a function of the
  input space size rather than a function of the non-zero input
  elements. 
  % and implementations have focused on tasks with dense input space,
  % while at most emulating random memory access on sparse input data.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient splitting algorithm to
  leverage input sparsity within decision tree
  methods. 
  % We exploit the a-priori knowledge that each column has very few
  % non-zero elements and show how learning time is significantly
  % decreased.
  Our algorithm improves training time over sparse datasets by more
  than two orders of magnitude and it will be incorporated in the next
  version of \emph{scikit-learn}\footnote{http://scikit-learn.org},
  the most popular open source Python machine learning library.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We proposed a method for building tree-based models with sparse input
support.  Our method takes advantage of input sparsity by avoiding
sorting sample sets of a node along a feature unless they are nonzero
at that feature. This approach speeds up training substantially as
sorting is a costly but essential and ubiquitous component of
tree-based models.
